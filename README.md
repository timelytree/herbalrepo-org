### Herbal Repository | An index of the world's plant medicines

The Herbal Repository is a free and open encyclopedia, maintained by Nauras Jabari and contributed to by a variety scientific and medical professionals. Here we aim to describe herbs and plants that have beneficial medicinal properties, focusing primarily on human clinical trials. We also catalogue results from animal trials, strong subjective evidence, and anecdotal evidence from various cultures that have used herbal medicines for thousands of years. Beyond serving as an encyclopedia of medicinal herbs, we strive to provide accurate dosage information for ingestion methods such as teas, tinctures, and capsules.
