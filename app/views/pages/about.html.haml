        %h6 OUR VISION
        %p Here we aim to describe herbs and plants that have beneficial medicinal properties, focusing primarily on human clinical trials. We also catalogue results from animal trials, strong subjective evidence, and anecdotal evidence from various cultures that have used herbal medicines for thousands of years. Beyond serving as an encyclopedia of medicinal herbs, we strive to provide accurate dosage information for ingestion methods such as teas, tinctures, and capsules.

          %li Make it actually pleasant and easy on the eyes to read. We like it when text is well-presented as much as you do!
